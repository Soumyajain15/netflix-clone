### Features:

- **Navigation Bar**: Mimics the Netflix top navigation bar with elements like logos, search bar, and user profile.
- **Movie Rows**: Display movie posters in a horizontal scrollable layout, similar to Netflix's content presentation.
- **Hover Effects**: Adds interactivity with hover effects on movie posters and navigation elements.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented smooth scrolling between different movie sections.

## Features
